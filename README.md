# 🎄 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) ⚗️

My personal solutions to AoC puzzles, in Elixir.

I'm brand new to Elixir, so this is largely practice for me. My solutions are
likely not the best examples of "good" Elixir. If you see anything particularly
egregious or have a cool way to improve a solution, feel free to submit an
issue or pull request.

## Usage

Solutions and test are structured by year and day.
For example, the solution for 2020's day 1 is
`lib/advent/y2020/01_report_repair.ex` and its respective test is
`test/y2020/01_report_repair_test.exs`.
Each solution is tested for the example and puzzle input. Each day's input file
lives under the `test/<year>/support/` directory.
