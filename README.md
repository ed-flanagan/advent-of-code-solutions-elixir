# 🎄 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) ⚗️

My personal solutions to AoC challenges in Elixir.

## Usage

Solutions and test are structured by year and day.
For example, the solution for 2020's day 1 is
`lib/advent/y2020/01_report_repair.ex` and its respective test is
`test/y2020/01_report_repair_test.exs`.
Each solution is tested for the example and puzzle input. Each day's input file
lives under the `test/<year>/support/` directory.
