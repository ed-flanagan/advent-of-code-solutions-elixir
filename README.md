# 🎄 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) ⚗️

My personal solutions to AoC puzzles, in Elixir.

*Caveat:* I'm brand new to Elixir, so this is largely practice for me. My
solutions are likely not the best examples of "good" Elixir. If you see
anything particularly egregious or have a cool way to improve a solution, feel
free to submit an issue.

## Usage

Solutions and tests are structured by year and day.
For example, the solution for 2020's day 1 is `lib/advent/y2020/d01.ex` and
its respective test is `test/y2020/d01_test.exs`. If a puzzle had an input
file you'll find it under a test `support` directory, e.g.
`test/y2020/support/d01_input.txt`.
